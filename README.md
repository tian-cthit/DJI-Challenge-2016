# 3D reconstruction with a quadrotor as platform

3D reconstruction based on [Octomap](http://wiki.ros.org/octomap) is performed to complete [DJI Developer Challenge 2016](https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-kicks-off-2016-dji-developer-challenge). A stereo vision camera is used as the sensor to collect point cloud data which will be processed and transformed to octomap for the usage of searching and rescure tasks.

Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS indigo is used.
